## Install
After installing the dependencies, download this entire repository. All pyCUDA functions are contained in gpu_tanimoto_popcount.py. Copy this file into the same directory as the program that needs to use it.

## Demo
To test that all the modules are working, run demo.py in the demo directory. This script compares 50,000 x 50,000 molecules.
